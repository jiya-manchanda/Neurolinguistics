I hope to explore the process of concept acquisition in humans and critically evaluate whether connectionist artificial intelligence systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), can acquire abstract concepts in a manner akin to human cognition (Cherkassky & Lee, 2024). Specifically, my focus will be the neuroscience underlying language production (Xing et al., 2018), in light of the problem of abstraction within the empiricist framework of epistemology (Spelke, 1998). Abstraction is central to the human capacity to form complex ideas and conceptual structures, enabling higher-order cognition and nuanced understanding (Laurence & Margolis, 2012). Given that concepts are foundational to language (McDonald & MacWhinney, 1991), my question is: can LLMs, despite their sophisticated capacity to produce language, possess “linguistic” competence in principle? Or, is it the case that are they fundamentally constrained due to a lack of concept acquisition abilities?
The format of my project will be in the form of a Python coded program that will simulate key cognitive processes in both humans and AI models. Since I think this is the position I will be taking on the question, the program will illustrate how human brains use sensory data to form abstract concepts (Perhaps. I might actually be a nativist. Time will tell. That would certainly help in drawing out the contrast between humans and computers on this matter) and how AI relies on pattern recognition without true conceptual understanding. The program will include two primary classes: one representing the human mind and the other representing the AI model. Through functions like perceive() and generate_output(), the program will represent a comparison between how humans form concepts versus how AI processes large-scale data to produce linguistic outputs without underlying concepts. The code will also include a section where users can input concepts (e.g., “justice” or “freedom”) [this part is interesting but I am not sure what I will do with it yet]. In the comments between sections of the code, I will have analysis just like I might in a research paper that provides context for how I will be arguing through the psychological and philosophical perspectives on the question that my topic poses. 
Moving forward, I will expand my research to include databases such as PsychInfo, Web of Science, JSTOR, and PubMed to obtain a more comprehensive set of references, ensuring a robust theoretical and empirical foundation for this inquiry. In the meantime, here are a few sources I have found that are initial sketches of the literature I am looking at (I have read about half of them over the summer).
